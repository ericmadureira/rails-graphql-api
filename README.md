# GraphQL API
## GraphQL
Developed by people at Facebook as an alternative to the REST architecture. It has some advantages like:
 * we can request for all the data we need in one go.
 * it returns only the data we need.
 * it reduces the need for API versioning by providing tools for continuous evolution of the GraphQL schema.
 * we only require one endpoint for all our requests.
